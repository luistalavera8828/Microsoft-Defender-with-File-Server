# Microsoft-Defender-with-File-Server
As a result of the pandemic that arose in 2019, one of the technological models that began to be adopted more quickly; is cloud computing, so much so that Microsoft reported a 775% increase in cloud storage in 2020. But this also brings with it many attacks when adopting this technology, which is why Microsoft also reported an average annual ransomware attack of 100 million attacks in the last fiscal year (2020 - 2021).

It is important to note that cybercriminals are constantly trying to hijack the data of any organization; thus, 65% of the companies that paid the ransom were able to recover their data while 29% were only able to partially recover their information. That said, we can point out that attackers are still looking for attack vectors that allow them to obtain the most sensitive information of the organization (files, backups, etc); so that they can encrypt it, divulge it, extort it, etc.

The document that is attached to this project (project to be able to apply and approve the master in cybersecurity) you will be able to know how to implement a contingency plan for a file server against a ransomware attack with an architecture in Microsoft Azure that allows us to do the following:

Continuously synchronize our file server with a Microsoft Azure service.

Generate preventive backups when the Microsoft Defender service detects an attack.

Visualization of the behavior of the Microsoft Defender service when a ransomware has been copied and/or executed on our file server.

Finally, it is important to point out that the document is in Spanish and the English version will be published in the future.
